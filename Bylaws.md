Current iteration approved by Austin IWW Branch Members 11/10/23

## Article I: Values and Jurisdiction

### Section 1
The Austin General Membership Branch (GMB) shall nurture workplace and industrial organizing, and end encourage and 
build worker solidarity.  As part of the IWW, and in recognition of the fact that an injury to one is an injury to all, 
the Austin branch of the IWW actively opposes discrimination.  No wage or salaried worker (as defined as eligible by the
[IWW Constitution](https://iww.org/assets/iww-constitution.pdf)) shall be excluded from the GMB because of race,
ethnicity, sex, nationality, creed, disability, sexual orientation, age, or gender identity.

## Article II: Members

### Section 1
All members of the IWW who live or work in Travis County, TX, and pay dues through the Austin GMB shall be considered 
branch members.  Other members may choose to affiliate if they can reasonably participate and the branch votes to accept
them.

### Section 2
If potential members outside of Travis County or surrounding counties are in what is considered an "active campaign" by the IWW Austin Organizing Board, they may apply to be members of the Austin GMB. Their membership must be voted on by members in the nearest business meeting by simple majority if quorum is met, or on the next business meeting with quorum until a closer a GMB until a closer GMB, Job Branch, or IUB is formed. Once that body is formed, they must hold their own elections, their own meetings and move to establish their own working branch seperate from the IWW Austin GMB.

All members of the Austin GMB in good standing are entitled to vote as part of the GMB, may be appointed to committees,
and may run for an officer position.

Manual of Policies and Procedures, and these Bylaws.

   lawsuit, etc.) should be reported to the GEB through the branch's assigned board representative.
2. Be the custodian of all branch records.
3. Be responsible for maintaining the branch membership list.

### Section 3: Branch Correspondence Secretary
The branch correspondence secretary is an optional position that may assist the branch secretary with duties related to 
correspondence (in the MPP enumerated 3,5,7 as of March 2020). If no correspondence secretary is elected, the branch

   questions relating to the branch.

The Branch Organizing Department Liason shall be the resonsible custodian of duties related to the branch organizing committee.

   branch, including the recording of all income and expenses and securing the branch treasury. Records are kept of all 
   transactions with delegates.

   Department of Labor (DoL) and the branch treasurer must file the necessary Labor Organization Information Reports.
4. If the branch charter is revoked the branch secretary and treasurer should work with an authorized union 
   representative to surrender the charter and union supplies, property, and funds to the General Administration.

   collected during the month, shall be sent to the General Secretary- Treasurer (GST) no later than the 10th day of the 
   following month. Should any branch fail to do so, further supplies will be withheld until those reports are received. 
   Failure to report monthly will cause headquarters' records to become out of date and list members in bad standing. 
   These members will then not receive the General Organization Bulletin (GOB), referendum ballots, or the Industrial 
   Worker (IW).

### Section 6: Harassment & Grievance Officer
The branch shall appoint at least one harassment & grievance officer (“HGO”), who shall be responsible for receiving and

   nominations will be taken at that meeting, with election of an interim officer taking place at the following GMB 
   meeting.

   either getting back into good standing or resigning.

   candidates will be held.) Votes will be on a secret ballot. The branch will vote for an election officiator to 
   create, distribute, collect, and count the ballots. This vote will occur two months before the officer election, and 
   the officiator cannot run for office in that election. Ballots must be retained by the branch for at least one year.

   upcoming fiscal year and it will be voted on by branch membership at the first June meeting.

### Section 11: Austin GMB Treasury
In order to maintain equitable control of branch finances, at least the secretary and treasurer must be signers on the 
branch bank account at all times.
1. Officer Transition and Branch Treasury
   1. Upon the election of new branch officers, the outgoing officers should facilitate removing themselves as signers 
      of the branch bank account, typically by arranging a time for all outgoing and incoming officers to meet in person 
      at the bank and hand over signer access. Once this transition is completed, the incoming branch treasurer must 
      inform GHQ of the change of account signers and provide the names of the new signers.

      be followed:
      1. The incoming branch treasurer must contact GHQ (and provide evidence of their election to the BT position, if 
         this has not previously been communicated) and explain the need to override the current branch signers.
      2. GHQ must then produce a notarized statement stating the following: 
         1. That Austin IWW is a chartered branch of the broader IWW.

   account.

## Article IV: Policies and Procedures

### Section 1: Voting Philosophy
Decisions will be made using a simple majority vote. 

### Section 2: Voting Procedures
We use the polling tool in our Discord channel to conduct online voting for votes between meetings. The branch secretary 
will be responsible for counting, and reporting these motions and outcomes to the GMB.
1. Quorum (5 members in good standing) is interpreted as the minimum number of respondents in a vote. Members who do not 
   respond to a vote are interpreted as not present; they are not presumed to be abstaining.
2. Online votes must be open for a minimum of 3 days (72 hours). It may be extended up to 30 days by the proposer at any 
   time or by anyone until quorum is met.
3. An emergency vote must receive at least 1.5 times quorum (1.5 times 5 members) (round up, up to the total number of 
   members), pass with a simple majority, and be open for a minimum of 1 day (24 hours) or until a simple majority of 
    all members in good standing have voted in favor. Emergency votes do not have options to abstain or block. If quorum 
    is not met within 3 days (72 hours), the vote proceeds with normal non-emergency practice.
4. Branch meetings will be the primary method of holding votes and regular quorum will apply.
5. Only members in the branch in good standing may vote.

### Section 3: Meetings
The Austin IWW branch shall hold meetings every other week. Only members of the IWW in good standing and venue staffers may ateend general business meetings. IWW members who are members of ATX GMB will have voice and vote. IWW members who are not members of ATX GMB have voice but no vote.

### Section 4: Amendment of Bylaws
Amendments to these bylaws may be proposed no later than prior to annual elections and will be voted on there by all 
eligible members of the Austin GMB. In extraordinary circumstances, amendments may be proposed before the next GMB 
meeting and voted on by the membership at that time. Amendment votes will require a simple majority to be passed.

## Article V: Harassment Policy

### Section 1: Harassment Grievance Procedure
In the interests of preserving solidarity within the branch, there shall be a localized process for handling harassment 
reports via internal mediation, particularly in regards to conflicts arising out of racist, sexist, homophobic, 
transphobic, and other forms of discriminatory or hateful behavior. In addition, it shall be the responsibility of the 
branch to support internal discussion and education in regards to these issues. This process shall be used to deal with 
internal mediation amongst branch members in accordance with the IWW constitution and bylaws where applicable. The 
process will proceed as follows:
1. The filing for internal mediation by one member of the branch against another, provided that the two parties do not 
   belong to the same Industrial Union, Industrial Union Branch, or Job Shop, shall be heard by the branch. If the 
   grieving party and the accused belong to the same Industrial Union, Industrial Union Branch, or Job Shop, and the 
   respective body does not have a process for hearing internal mediation, the branch may be asked to hear the internal 
   mediation.
2. The member filing for internal mediation shall do so by sending a letter to any branch delegate and the branch 
   secretary stating their request with a description of the alleged offense(s), along with relevant documentation.
   1. The receiving officer(s) will be required to place the item on the agenda at the following business meeting, and 
      such item shall be marked as "election of mediation committee".
3. The membership shall elect a committee of at least 3 members in continuous good standing for 6 months prior, none of 
   whom are either of the parties involved in the dispute. 
   1. The membership may vote to waive the six month requirement if they deem it necessary.
4. The committee shall within 30 days conduct an inquiry of the issue(s), consult the parties involved, and upon 
   consulting the party filing for internal mediation and the accused shall make a recommendation of action. This 
   recommendation shall not be acted upon unless such action is agreeable to both parties and the committee, in which 
   case it shall be read to the membership at the next business meeting, along with the complaint. Also, a statement may 
   be made by each party involved if they wish.
5. If the mediation committee cannot reach a recommendation within 30 days, the committee may ask for an extension of 
   them to complete the inquiry, or recommend that the matter be referred to the GEB.
6. The aggrieved party may withdraw a mediation request at any time, but may not refile within the branch for that 
   offense, and may not file for mediation locally if the matter has been settled by the GEB.
7. If the issue(s) cannot be resolved with the above process, the membership may call a special meeting to reach a 
   solution.
8. No member shall be denied the use of the branch mediation process by any subordinate body, in accordance with these 
   bylaws and IWW constitution.
9. No member shall be denied union representation on the job, or voting privileges by the branch, unless their 
   membership has been suspended or revoked in accordance with the IWW constitution and bylaws.

## Article VI: Safer Spaces

### Section 1: Acknowledgement of Values
The Industrial Workers of the World is a union committed to the emancipation of the working class. The working class is 
diverse and as a union we recognize that oppression is many-layered. As such, we strive to keep our common places free 
from oppressive action, behavior, and language. These oppressive actions and words include but are not limited to: 
racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and any expression of disrespect and/or intolerance of size, gender identity, 
sexual identity/expression, (dis)ability, age, educational level, and cultural background. Because we want to learn from 
and educate each other, we will each be responsible for addressing these issues in ourselves and others. This policy is 
not about censorship, but rather opening a dialogue in a respectful way that can result in all members feeling safe and 
free to fully participate in their union’s activities. If a member feels this policy has been violated, the following 
steps should be taken:
1. Reference the policy to the whole group: for example, “In the IWW, we have a ‘Safer Space Policy’ that all members 
   are mutually responsible to uphold. I feel this policy has been violated by talk of ‘\[comments made\].’ Please keep 
   the Safer Space Policy in mind.”
2. If the policy is still being violated, the issue should be brought up to the person in violation directly and/or the 
   chair, an officer, a delegate, or a member whom you would like to act as an advocate on your behalf so that an 
   effective plan of action can be instituted.
3. If you have no allies locally and invoking the ‘Safer Space Policy’ fails, reach out to the Gender Equity Committee 
   for assistance at GEC@IWW.org.
4. If a member feels like this policy is being violated and is uncomfortable bringing this up personally, they are 
   encouraged to seek an ally of their choosing to advocate for them. In a meeting, a person can ask for a point of 
   personal privilege to take a break and discuss this with the necessary parties. Meeting chairs, officers, delegates, 
   and members should be conscious of this policy and address issues as they arise.
5. Further, space shall be defined as any office, meeting, event (including trainings, celebrations, social gatherings, 
   etc.), or internet platforms (including listservs, facebook, we.riseup, twitter, etc.) that are IWW-sponsored. This 
   includes any body formally recognized by the IWW, such as General Membership Branches, Regional Organizing Committees 
   and Regional Administrations, Industrial Union Branches, other committees, and any accountable subformation of the 
   aforementioned bodies.

## Article VII Committees

### Section 1: Committee Establishment
The Austin GMB may establish standing or special committees to carry out the tasks of the branch. Committee members 
shall be elected at the branch meeting which creates the committee, and committee membership may be altered at later 
branch meetings, or committees may be disbanded. The branch shall specify when these committees shall report to the 
branch when they are created.

### Section 2: Budget and Audit Committee
Each April, the branch will select a three-person Budget and Audit Committee that will gather delegate reports and 
banking records from the previous fiscal year. Using this information, the committee shall create a budget for the 
upcoming fiscal year and it will be voted on by branch membership at the first June meeting.

### Section 3: Branch Contact List
The branch contact list is moderated by the branch secretary. Moderation will include adding new members of the branch 
onto the contact list and composing communications. 

One other person, designated by the branch secretary, will have moderator access to the list. In August of each year, 
the branch secretary will work with GHQ and branch delegates to remove members of the list who have fallen into bad 
standing.

## Article VIII: Conflicts between Bylaws and the Constitution

### Section 1: Clarification
All parts of these bylaws conflicting with the IWW Constitution are null and void.

## Article IX: Criteria for Dissolving Branches

### Section 1: Criteria
The Austin GMB will operate subject to the chartering and charter dissolution criteria as laid out in the [IWW Manual of 
Policies and Procedures](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r_liXQVoSw0wArfaL7KBVevsvzXweYrM1t_cEWkDcZA/edit#heading=h.40rwhnf9fdox),
